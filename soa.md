# Matrix state of the art

Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over the Internet created in 2014 inside [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com), a company specialized in software and services for communications. The solution [Matrix](https://matrix.org) provides is fully decentralized and federated while group communication takes place in rooms. Each user is registered at a home-server and all messages in a communication room are replicated over all home-servers of the room’s participants. Thus, every home-server connected to a room, through a user in this room, keeps a content of the room’s history. If a home-server goes down, the conversation can still go on as the remaining home-servers are still exchanging messages. If a home-server is back online it can re-synchronise messages, i.e., receiving old ones from other home-servers and inserting its own into the timeline of others.

Matrix is openly [specified](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc) and [implemented](https://github.com/matrix-org) and its open source reference implementation server [*Synapse*](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) and client *Riot*, now available as [*Element*](https://github.com/vector-im), already have several astute security features and allow end-to-end encryption. Starting in 2018 the French Government, via the DINSIC department, deployed a private federation of [Matrix home servers](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-dinsic) and [*Tchap*](https://github.com/tchapgouv), an open source fork of Riot. The French National Cybersecurity Agency, ANSSI, is jointly working on a cybersecurity audit of Tchap. Interesting security features are end-to-end capable search and turning on end-to-end encryption by default for rooms with private history.

Other notable open source implementations of Matrix are:

- Matrix home-server: [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) is a second-generation implementation of Matrix home-server written in Go! containing a small memory footprint with better baseline performance than Synapse that, since the end of 2020, entered in a beta version,  which means that it passes [*syntest*](https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest), the Matrix standard blackbox integration test suite for home-servers, and [complement](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement), the Go! specific test suite;
- Matrix clients: [Quaternion](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion) and [Spectral](https://github.com/spectral-im/spectral) two desktop clients written in C++, [Seaglass](https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass) a macOS client written in Swift, [Fractal](https://github.com/GNOME/fractal) a client for GNOME written in Rust, [Gomatrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrix) a Golang Matrix client, [Koma](https://github.com/koma-im) a Matrix client written in Kotlin, Matrix-client-el, SimpleMatrix, Scylla.

Matrix employs the end-to-end encryption protocol developed by [*Signal*](https://github.com/signalapp), a free open source voice, video, and instant messaging application, which was heavily audited and is considered one of the most secure applications available. The end-to-end encryption protocol is built on the [Double Ratchet algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_algorithm), triple [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman) handshake, and prekeys. It uses [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519), [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-256), and [HMAC-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-SHA256) for its encryption algorithms. While all secure messenger services apply encryption to messages, most do not apply this to the message metadata. Signal encrypted metadata and stores it encrypted at the clients' end while the only information that is stored on the servers for each account is the registration phone number, the date and time of joining the service, and the date of the last log-on.
